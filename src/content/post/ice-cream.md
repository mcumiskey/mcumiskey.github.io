I love ice cream. I love Philadelphia. I am incapable of eating ice cream and NOT having an opinion on the different options available. 

It's important to note that this list is not exhaustive; I am but one person, and there is only so much ice cream I can convince the people in my life to eat. I will continue to update my review as I visit more venues and sample more flavors. 

# [Milk Jawn](https://milkjawn.com/) ★★★★★ (5/5)
**Flavors Sampled:** Tahini Fudge Swirl, Cold Brew and Caramelized Cacao Nibs, Earl Grey with Honeycomb, Lemon Curd with Blueberry Basil Swirl

Milk Jawn makes fantastic ice cream. It is currently my favorite in Philly due to it's fantastic texture, well-balanced flavors, and exciting options. I have yet to try a Milk Jawn flavor that I did not like. 

I believe Milk Jawn has something for everyone. They have fruity ice cream, non-dairy options, interesting takes on classic choices, and are just genuinely very good. 

# [1-900-ICE-CREAM](https://1900icecream.com/) ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
**Flavors Sampled:** Vietnamese Coffee Crunch (ice cream bar - divided in four and shared), Apple Cider Donut, Oatmeal Cream Supreme, Graham Cracker 

1-900-Ice-Cream is a delight to visit because the flavors change so often. There is always something new to try, and they get bonus points for offering unique flavors of soft serve and ice cream sandwiches. 

That being said, 1-900 is INCREDIBLY sweet, and the mix-ins can make the scoops very dense. It has made a lot of the flavors hit-or-miss for me. I have yet to finish anything from 1-900 alone: it either needs to be wrapped up and finished later, or shared with a friend. 

Probably the ideal place to take a child under 16. 

# [Vita](https://www.vitainphilly.com/) ★★★★★ (5/5)
**Flavors Sampled:** Lemon Sorbetto, Passion Fruit 

Vita is a gelateria with a neat speakeasy behind their red door. While I have yet to try their secret italian food, their gelato offerings have been incredibly good. 

I would recommend their fruity flavors over the basic chocolates and vanillas. 

# [Van Leeuwen](https://vanleeuwenicecream.com/) ★★★☆☆ (3/5)
**Flavors Sampled:** Earl Grey Tea, Brown Sugar Chunk   

Van Leeuwen is not my favorite. It's ice cream, so it is not bad, but they don't have the best consistency. My general review for their flavors is 'other people do it better'. 

The Earl Grey flavor also has an odd aftertaste that does not complement the flavor well.

# [Gran Caffe L’Aquila](https://grancaffelaquila.com/) ★★★★★ (5/5)
**Flavors Sampled:** Desire, Caffe, Pescamango

Unlike Vita, I have had Gran Caffe's (non-secret) italian food, and they have a delicious carbonara with savory bacon gelato! Unfortunately, that is not offered as one of their normal scoops. 

Their gelato offerings do not change often, but their flavors are all very well-balanced and high quality. I believe in choosing the options that sound most italian, but always ask the server their favorites. No one has led me astray yet!

# Jeni’s ★★★★☆ (4/5)
**Flavors Sampled:** I've Had So Many Oh No 

Jeni's has fun seasonal varieties, good texture, good flavor. It's genuinely enjoyable ice cream that comes with two little waffle pieces, which are perfect. 

It's not a local brand, but it's in a very convenient location for quick pick up ice creams. 

Darkest chocolate is specifically good to have as a pint for milkshakes. 

# Franklin Fountain ★★★★☆ (4/5)
**Flavors Sampled:** Matcha (no samples available :() 

Franklin Fountain is a very cute location with some fun seasonal flavors (including corn in fall 2024 when I visited!)

However, there is no taste testing. Only commitment. 

Their matcha was good, it was a little gritty compared to my partner's cotton candy scoop, and their ice cream is thick but not overly sweet. I think it's definitely a fun local to check out, but a little out of my way so I don't think I'll be a regular.
