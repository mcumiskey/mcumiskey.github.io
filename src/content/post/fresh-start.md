# Fresh Start

Fresh Start is a multidisciplinary public health projects aimed towards teaching college students 'mindful' drinking strategies through a narrative game as an alternative alcohol education program. The project was began by Dr. Yifeng Hu and Professor Josh Fishburn.

*All screenshots are from the 2019 build of the project. The project remains a collaborative effort, and does not represent the work of one student. However, pieces that I worked on are highlighted.*

## Publications:  

Our work was highlighted by [The College of New Jersey](https://news.tcnj.edu/2020/01/27/fresh-approach-to-alcohol-education/)

The team also published two abstracts to the 2020 Digital Games Research Association (DiGRA) conference:

## Programming Role: 

The game is built in Unity, using C++ and a dialog engine called Yarn, using the Unity plugin YarnSpinner. 

I​​​​​​ served as a programming generalist, helping out with various projects as needed. 

My initial project was the 'Drink Pouring Game'

The educational goal of this mini-game is to teach people how much alcohol is in one 'standard drink', as defined by the National Institute of Health. A red solo cup is used for approximate measuring, and to give college students a frame of reference. 

The game teaches through trial-and-error, with a focus on giving feedback so players progress with the correct amount of alcohol. It also serves as a visualization of a 'standard drink' for players. 

I also developed a mini-quiz to evaluate user learning at different narrative stages.

Once again, the design is focused on trial-and-error, and players are not scored, just given feedback and new opportunities. 

## Artist Role: 

As a multidisciplinary team member, I was responsible for background design, asset creation for all mini-games, and assisting our character artist.
